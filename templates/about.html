    <div><img src="/static/images/about.jpg" class="rounded-circle" alt="Chocolates" width="60%" style="border:2px dotted black;"></div>
    <p class="col-xl-12 py-3">Here at The Chocolate Society, we seek to explore a world of wonderful fine chocolate possibilities. We want<br> to showcase chocolate in its very best light; handmade, fresh and skilfully crafted with imaginative flavours<br> that will surprise and delight you. We create truffles, pralines, caramels and bon bons with nuanced flavours<br> and sublime textures to delight your palate, perfectly completed with a delicate finish and fine, artistic<br> decoration.</p>
    <p class="col-x1-12">The Chocolate Society crafts fine fresh chocolates from their professional chocolate kitchen in rural Somerset.<br> Alasdair Garnsworthy is the innovative Head Chocolatier at the helm of the business. Having discovered a<br> talent for chocolate, he totally reinvented the company, giving it a new lease of life and a vibrant burst of <br>creative flair to bring The Chocolate Society to where it is today.</p>
    <p class="col-x1-12">In origin, The Chocolate Society was established in 1991 by 3 fine chocolate enthusiasts. The first 20 years of<br> its life was dedicated to moving people's ideas and expectations for chocolate beyond the low-grade<br> commodity confection we first meet as children, towards the fabulous diversity of high-end chocolate.</p>
    <p class="col-x1-12">During this time, The Chocolate Society produced artisan fresh chocolate truffles, caramels and chocolate<br>bars in Yorkshire. They generated an enthusiastic following through 3 London Stores and a national wholesale<br>customer base.</p>
    <p class="col-x1-12">However, The Chocolate Society was set on a new path when sold to new owners in 2007. And it experienced<br> a swift decline in fortunes when the financial crisis hit home in the UK economy. When Alasdair and his<br> brother acquired The Chocolate Society in 2010, administrators had already closed the factory and sold off<br> the equipment. The Garnsworthy brothers acquired the intangible business assets leftover from the  sad<br> dissolution of the business.</p>
    <p class="col-x1-12">The Chocolate Society has thus been reborn with a sincere commitment to quality and flavour; a solid <br>foundation from which our business is set to grow. We are located in rolling Somerset countryside, and this<br> beautiful setting always gives us fresh perspective. But the desire to share our passion for exquisite, fresh<br> chocolate, knows no bounds.</p>
